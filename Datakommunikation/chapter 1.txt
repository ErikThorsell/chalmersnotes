1.1.1 - A Nuts and Bolts Description
 - Hosts = End Systems <=> Web cams, computers, servers, smartphones, etc...
 - End Systems are connected by a network of communication links and packet 
   switches (i.e. routers and link-layer switches).
 - Transmission rate [bits/sec].

1.1.3 - Protocols
 - A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between 
   two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the 
   trans- mission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

1.2 - The Network Edge
 - Hosts divided into clients and servers.
 - DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) uses different frequencies to send data 
   and a DSLAM encodes these and routees them to either the phone network 
   or the Internet. Travels 5-10 miles.
 - Cable makes use of television companies. Fiber to a node -> coaxial cable.
 - FTTH (Fiber to the Home)
 - Dial-Up
 - Satellite

1.3.1 - Packet switching
 - Packets are transmitted from a source to a destination. Over each 
   communication link its rate are equal to the full transmission rate 
   of the link.
 - L = bits in package
 - R = rate [bits/sec]
 - Time to transmit package = L/R
 - Store and forward transmission: Packet switch must receive the entire 
   packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto 
   the outbound link.
 - d_{end-to-end} = N*(L/R)    (N links of rate R, there are N-1 routers 
                                between source and destination)
 - Forwarding table maps destination addresses to that routers outbound links. 
   If the router doesn't know the whole address it can look at a part of it 
   and send the package on the right way. (Example with gas stations.)

1.3.2 - Circuit Switching
 - The resources needed along a path to provide for communication between the 
   end systems are reserved!
 - In packet switching every packet uses resources on demand and may have to 
   wait.
 - ANALOGY: Circuit Switching <=> Restaurant w/ reservation.
            Packet Switching  <=> Restaurant w/o reservation.
 - Traditional phone networks are circuit-switched networks.
 - FDM (Frequency division multiplexing) 
 - TDM (Time division multiplexing)
 
 - Packet Switching > Circuit Switching since it's very unlikely that all 
   the lines will be occupied at once. (Example: Page 31)

1.3.3 - A Network of Networks
 Network Structure 1: Interconnects all of the access ISPs with a single global 
                      transit ISP.
 Network Structure 2: Consists of hundreds of thousands of ISPs and multiple 
                      global transit ISPs.
                      NS2 is a two-tier hierarchy w/ global transit providers 
                      residing as the top tier and access ISPs as the bottom 
                      tier.
                      Access ISP -> Regional ISP -> Tier-1 ISP (a dozen)
 Network Structure 3: Multi-tier hierarchy i.e. in China. Additional smaller 
                      ISPs between Access and Tier-1.
                      To build a network that resembles today's internet we 
                      must add: Points of Presence (PoP), multi-homing, 
                      peering and Internet eXchange Points (IXP).

 - PoP: A group of one or more routers and exist in all levelse of the 
        hierarchy - except for the bottom. Customer ISPs can connect into 
        the provider ISP.
 - Multi home: Connect to two or more provider ISPs. I.e. connect w/ tier-1 
               and regional ISP.
 - Peer: ISPs connect their networks directly and avoid going upstreams.
 - IXP: Multiple ISPs can peer together. 300 IXPs in the internet today. 

 Network Structure 4: access ISPs, regional ISPs, tier-1 ISPs, PoPs, 
                      multi-homing, peering, IXPs
 Network Structure 5: Describes the internet of 2012. Uses NS4 and adds  
                      content provider networks. (Google) They have teir 
                      own network and bypass the upper tiers of the internet 
                      by peering with lower-tier ISPs either by connecting 
                      with them or connecting with them via IXPs.

1.4.1 - Overview of Delay in Packet Switched Networks
 (Nodal) Processing Delay: Time required to examine the packet's header and 
                           determine where to direct it. Can also include 
                           time needed to check for bit-level errors.
                           [Microseconds]
 Queuing Delay:            [Microseconds to milliseconds]
 Transmission Delay:       Assuming FIFO.
                           L = length of packet by bits
                           R = rate [bits/sec]
                           Transmission delay = L/R, the amount of time required 
                           to push all of the packet's bits into the link.
                           [Microseconds to milliseconds]
 Propagation Delay:        Time required to propagate from beginning of the link 
                           to end router. Depends on the physical medium and 
                           is in the range of 2*10^8 m/s to 3*10^8 m/s.
                           [Distance/propagation speed]
 Total Nodal Delay:        Sum of above

 - Example (Page 38)

1.4.2 - Queueing Delay and Packet Loss
 Queuing Delay:     a = average rate at which packets arrive at queue [packets/sec]
                    R = Transmission rate
                    All packets consists of L bits.
                    - Average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is La bits/sec.
                    - Assume infinite queue => La/R = Traffic intensity.
                    - If La/R > 1 the avg rate at which bits arrive at the queue 
                      exceedes the rate at which it can be transmitted from the 
                      queue. We have packet loss.
                    - Applet exampel

1.4.3 - End to End Delay
 Assume: N-1 routers between source and destination.
         Uncongested => No Queuedelay
         Processing delay @ router = d_proc
         Transmission rate = R bits/sec
         Propagation on each link is d_prop
         => d_{end-to-end} = N(d_proc + d_trans + d_prop)

1.5.1 - Layered Architecture
 Application Layer: Network applications and their application-layer protocol 
                    resides here.
                    Distributed over multiple end systems with the application 
                    in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets 
                    of information w/ the application in another system.
                    [Message]
                    Example: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS
 Transport Layer:   Transport application-layer messages between application 
                    end points. The Internet has two: TCP and UDP.
                    TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its 
                    applications. Guaranteed delivery of application-layer 
                    messages and flow control. TCP also breaks long messages 
                    into shorter segments and provide a congestion-control 
                    mechanism.
                    UDP provides a connectionless service. This is a no-frills 
                    service that provides no reliability, flow-control or 
                    congestion control.
                    [Segment]
 Network Layer:     Moving [datagrams] from one host to another. The TCP or UDP 
                    passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address 
                    to the network-layer. The network-layer then provides the 
                    service of delivering the segment to the transport layer 
                    of the destination host.
                    Example: IP, routing protocols.
Link Layer:         To move a packet from one nod (host or router) to the next 
                    node in the route the network layer relies on the link layer.
                    At each node the network layer passes the datagram down to 
                    the link layer which delivers the datagram to the next 
                    node along the route. 
                    Example: Ethernet, WiFi, DOCSIS Protocols. 
                    [Frames]
Physical Layer:     Moves the individual bits within the grame from one node 
                    to the next. Depends on transmission medium.

1.6 - Networks under attack
 Malware:   Collective name for all malicious stuff.
 Botnet:    Multiple hosts infected by the same malware used to control them.
 Virus:     Malware that require so  form of user interaction to infext the 
            user's device.
Worms:      Malware that can enter a device without any explicit user 
            interaction.
DoS:        Denial of Service
            - Vulnerability attack: Sending a few, well crafted, messages to 
              a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted 
              host. 
            - Bandwidth flooding: The attacker sends a deluge of packets to 
              to the targeted host. So many that the target's access link 
              becomes clogged.
            - Connection flooding: The attacker establishes a large number 
              of half open or fully open TCP connections at the target host. 
              The host can become so bogged down with these that is stops 
              accepting legitimate connections.
DDos:       Distributed Denial of Service
            - One attacker uses several slaves to attack a specific victim.
Pack Sniff: A passive receiver records a copy of every packet send and 
            received. Is solved by encryption.
IP Spoof:   Injecting packets into the internet with a false source address.
            One of many ways to masquerade! Is solved by end point auth.
